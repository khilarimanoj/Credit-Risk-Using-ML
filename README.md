Title of the project is XYZ Corporation Lending Data Project. In this project, we work on the simpler problem that is to predict loan defaults. To classify if the borrower will default the loan using borrowerâ€™s finance history. That means, given a set of new predictor variables, we need to predict the target variable as 1 -> Defaulter or 0 -> Non-Defaulter.
